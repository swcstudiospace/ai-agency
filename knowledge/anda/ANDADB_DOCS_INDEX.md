# AndaDB Documentation Hub

This directory is the technical documentation hub for the AndaDB workspace.
Each document focuses on one layer of the stack, from the embedded database
engine to schema derivation, index internals, object-store-backed persistence,
the [KIP protocol](https://github.com/ldclabs/kip), and the Cognitive Nexus knowledge graph.

If you are new to the project, start here and then jump into the document that
matches the layer you are working on.

## What This Documentation Covers

The documents in this directory are intended to answer different kinds of
questions:

- What the core embedded database does and how to use it
- How schemas, documents, and derive macros work
- How exact-match, lexical, and vector indexes behave internally
- How persistence is built on top of [`anda_object_store`](./anda_object_store.md)
- How [KIP](https://github.com/ldclabs/kip) is parsed and executed
- How the Cognitive Nexus turns AndaDB into an AI memory graph

This directory is not meant to duplicate every crate README. For service-level
deployment instructions, environment variables, and binary-specific usage,
also check the crate READMEs under `rs/`.

## Layered View of the Stack

```text
Application / Agent Runtime
  -> anda_kip                    protocol, AST, request/response, executor trait
  -> anda_cognitive_nexus        reference KIP executor and knowledge graph
  -> anda_db                     embedded storage and retrieval core
     -> anda_db_schema           schema and document model
     -> anda_db_derive           derive macros for schema generation
     -> anda_db_btree            exact and range index
     -> anda_db_tfs              BM25 full-text index
     -> anda_db_hnsw             HNSW vector index
     -> anda_object_store        portable metadata and encryption wrappers
     -> object_store             backend abstraction for local and cloud storage
```

This structure is deliberate:

- `anda_db` is the embedded storage and retrieval core
- `anda_kip` is the protocol layer for model-friendly knowledge interaction
- `anda_cognitive_nexus` is the reference graph-memory system built on top of both

## Service-Layer Documentation

Some operational components are documented primarily in their own crate
READMEs rather than in this directory.

Use these when you need deployment guidance:

- `rs/anda_db_server/README.md` for the core database HTTP server
- `rs/anda_cognitive_nexus_server/README.md` for the KIP HTTP/JSON-RPC server
- `rs/anda_db_shard_proxy/README.md` for shard routing and multi-tenant proxying

## Practical Entry Points

If you need a fast answer to a concrete task, start with the closest document:

- Adding a collection and hybrid search: [anda_db.md](./anda_db.md)
- Designing field layouts and migration rules: [anda_db_schema.md](./anda_db_schema.md)
- Using derive macros on Rust structs: [anda_db_derive.md](./anda_db_derive.md)
- Debugging range filters: [anda_db_btree.md](./anda_db_btree.md)
- Tuning BM25 or tokenization: [anda_db_tfs.md](./anda_db_tfs.md)
- Tuning vector search recall and memory use: [anda_db_hnsw.md](./anda_db_hnsw.md)
- Understanding portable conditional writes or encryption-at-rest: [anda_object_store.md](./anda_object_store.md)
- Parsing or executing KIP: [anda_kip.md](./anda_kip.md)
- Understanding the AI memory graph runtime: [anda_cognitive_nexus.md](./anda_cognitive_nexus.md)

## Relation to the Project Root README

The project root [README.md](../README.md) is the product-level overview:

- what AndaDB is
- what the workspace crates are for
- how to get started quickly
- where to find the main examples

This `docs/README.md` is the documentation index for deeper technical study.
